    		<h3>Shreshth</h3>
    		<p>Shreshth has directed and designed for a bunch of realist theatre shows. Bored of naturalism, he is now venturing into puppetry, movement, and devised performance art. He is interested in telling real stories of love, distance, illness, and food through a magical and dreamy lens. This magic leads him to draw from Indian mythology and folklore, and fuels an interest in traditional forms of Indian art making.</p>
